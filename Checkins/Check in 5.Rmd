1. (Project Euler Problem 1) The natural numbers less than 10 that are divisible by 3 or 5 are 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these numbers is 23. Write R code to compute the sum of all the numbers less than 1000 that are divisible by 3 or 5.
```{r}
sum = 0
for (i in 1:999)
  if (i %% 3 == 0 | i %% 5 == 0)
    sum = sum + i

print(sum)
```
